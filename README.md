# Movie Review Classification with FastAI
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the process of building a movie review sentiment classification model using the FastAI framework. The model classifies movie reviews as positive or negative based on their textual content.

## Project Overview
The notebook walks through the following steps:

1. Dataset Loading: Using the IMDb dataset provided by FastAI, which consists of movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.
2. Text Preprocessing: Tokenizing and numericalizing the text data to prepare it for modeling.
3. Language Model Training: Training a language model to understand the contextual relationships within movie reviews.
4. Sentiment Classification: Fine-tuning the language model for sentiment analysis and classifying reviews.
5. Evaluation: Testing the model on unseen data to measure performance.
## Key Features
- Built using the FastAI framework, which simplifies many aspects of model training and deployment.
- Utilizes transfer learning by pretraining a language model before fine-tuning it for classification.
- Achieves 94% accuracy on the IMDb dataset, a strong result on this benchmark for sentiment analysis tasks.
